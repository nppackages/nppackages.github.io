# LSPARTITION

The `lspartition` package provides an R implementation of tuning parameter selection, point estimation, and pointwise and uniform inference procedures for partitioning-based least squares series estimators, including B-splines, wavelets, and piecewise polynomial regression estimators.

This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through grant [SES-1459931](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1459931).
